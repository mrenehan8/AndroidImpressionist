# AndroidImpressionist

This read me will describe how to use the program. The program is split up into two main portions. One ImageView on the left side and one ImpressionistView on the right side. The app can load images from the device directly onto the left side of the screen and the user can then draw impressionist versions of said image on the right side of the screen using distinct brush types. 

The first brush type is a simple Square Brush that simiply uses squares of a certain size to draw the impressionist drawing. The second brush time is a Circle Brush that uses circles instead of squares of the same size to draw the impressionist painting. The last brush type is the Square Pressure type that will use squares to draw the painting but the sizes of the squares depend on the pressure being pressed on the screen by the user. 

There are buttons below the two main views that allow users to download Jon's images from the URLs, load any image stored on the device, clear any impressionist drawings on the right hand side of the screen, save any drawings done on the screen, set the impressionst drawing in a black and white mode that only draws images in black and white, and set the images back to color mode to allow color functionality to the image. 

I did not use any specific sources to borrow code from or any distinct libraries outside of the Android standard libraries, but I did occassionaly look at the Android API just to see examples on how to properly use certain views such as the Spinner and SeekBars and to see what methods these views had.
